 Here you can find documentation on various aspects of the operating system and the project in general
 I plan on expanding this in the future, but for now I have written documentation on:

> - The source file [organization scheme](sources.md)
> - The [notation](notation.md) used throughout the project
> - A list of all the [classes](classes.md) which come together to make the OS
> - The [mailbox](mailbox.md) peripheral (only the VideoCore for now)
> - How [virtual memory](virtual_memory.md) is used in the OS (not really implemented properly for now)
> - Information on [exceptions/interrupts](exceptions.md) and how they are handled
> - Information on how the OS handles [memory management](memory.md) and on tha various classes which handle it
