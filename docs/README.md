# Documentation

 Here you can find documentation on various aspects of the operating system and the project in general
 I plan on expanding this in the future, but for now I have written documentation on:

> - The [notation](notation.md) used throughout the project
> - The [classes](classes.md) comprising the OS
> - The [mailbox](mailbox.md) peripheral
> - How [virtual memory](virtual_memory.md) is used in the OS
